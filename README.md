# FIle_Encryptor
Here are two programs. One program decrypts your file and the other one encrypts it.
In order to do that, the file you want to encrypt should be in the same directory as these programs. Then you can run FileEncrypt.cpp file to encrypt the file and whenever you want, you can run FileDecrypt.cpp file to Decrypt your file and follow the instructions in the program. Thank you.
